==============
Business Areas
==============

This module allows the user to link every invoice line to a business area
providing an additional dimension for analysis.


Usage
=====

This module is relevant when you are creating sales invoices and don't using analytic accounting.

Start using business areas by defining the cost centers.
Use the menu in the accounting module:

    **Configuration > Misc > Business Areas**

Once defined you can add a business area to an invoice line. A default business area for the current invoice can be set in header.

This module adds the business areas concept to the reporting module.

    **Accounting > Invoice Analysis**

Here you can select or unselect the business areas within your analysis.
